# BookWise - Your Smart Online Bookstore (Firebase Integrated)

BookWise is a modern, digital-first online bookstore built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. It leverages AI for book recommendations and aims to provide a seamless shopping experience for book lovers. This project integrates Firebase Firestore for book and user data management, and Firebase Storage for PDF file hosting. It includes a mock authentication system for admin role demonstration.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Next.js App Router**: For optimized routing and Server Components.
*   **React & TypeScript**: For a robust and type-safe frontend.
*   **ShadCN UI & Tailwind CSS**: For a beautiful, responsive, and customizable user interface.
*   **Genkit**: For integrating AI-powered book recommendations.
*   **Firebase Firestore**: For persistent storage and management of book and user metadata.
*   **Firebase Storage**: For hosting book PDF files uploaded via the admin panel.

*   **Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)**:
    *   **Protected Access**: Mock role-based access control (admin only).
    *   **Manage Books (CRUD)**: Interact directly with Firebase Firestore for book data.
    *   **PDF & Cover Image Uploads**: Upload files directly to Firebase Storage (URLs stored in Firestore).
    *   **Seed Database**: Populate Firestore 'books' and 'users' collections with initial data from `src/data/books.ts` and `src/data/users.ts`.

*   **Multi-Currency Display (Mock)**: Select a region (USD, EUR, KES) to see prices converted for display.
*   **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Responsive layout for all devices, including the admin panel.
*   **Server Actions**: Used for mutations (add, update, delete, seed) to ensure data integrity and server-side logic.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn
*   A Firebase Project:
    *   Set up Firebase Firestore (Native mode).
    *   Set up Firebase Storage.
    *   Obtain your Firebase project configuration credentials.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    # git clone <repository-url>
    # cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory by copying `.env` or creating it manually. Add your Firebase project configuration:
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID" # Crucial for Firestore/Storage
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID" # Optional

    # If using Genkit with Google AI, also include:
    # GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    **Important**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` is essential for Firebase services to work.

4.  **Configure Firebase Security Rules (for development/prototyping):**
    In your Firebase Console:

    *   **Firestore > Rules**: For easy development, you can use permissive rules. **IMPORTANT: These rules are NOT secure for production.**
        ```
        rules_version = '2';
        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
            // Allow read and write access to all paths for development
            // THIS IS NOT SECURE FOR PRODUCTION
            match /{document=**} {
              allow read, write: if true;
            }
          }
        }
        ```

    *   **Storage > Rules**: Similarly, for file uploads.
        ```
        rules_version = '2';
        service firebase.storage {
          match /b/{bucket}/o {
            match /{allPaths=**} {
              // Allow read and write access to all paths for development
              // THIS IS NOT SECURE FOR PRODUCTION
              allow read, write: if true;
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    For production, you would implement stricter rules, typically allowing writes only for authenticated admin users and appropriate read/write access for users based on their UID.

### Running the Development Server

1.  **Start the Next.js development server:**
    This will typically run the application on `http://localhost:9002` (as per `package.json`).
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **Start the Genkit development server (in a separate terminal, if using AI features):**
    This is required for the AI features to work. It usually runs on `http://localhost:3400`.
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    Or, for watching changes in AI flows:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the application.
To access the admin panel:
1. Click "Login" in the header.
2. Enter an admin email (e.g., `odhiambostallone73@gmail.com` from `src/data/users.ts`).
3. Navigate to [http://localhost:9002/admin](http://localhost:9002/admin).

### Seeding the Database

Once Firebase is configured and your app is running:
1.  Access the Admin Dashboard (`/admin` - requires mock admin login).
2.  Click "Seed Database with Mock Data" to populate Firestore 'books' collection.
3.  Click "Seed User Data" to populate Firestore 'users' collection.

## üìù Important Notes

*   **Authentication**: The admin panel (`/admin`) is currently protected by a **mock, client-side authentication system**. This is **NOT secure** and is for demonstration purposes only. Production environments require robust Firebase Authentication.
*   **User-Specific Data**: Cart functionality is currently browser-specific (using `localStorage`). True user-specific carts and features like download history require full Firebase Authentication and storing user-related data in Firestore, linked by user IDs.
*   **Firebase Costs**: Be mindful of Firebase usage, especially with Firestore reads/writes and Storage, as usage beyond the free tier may incur costs.
*   **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is in place. More robust error management might be needed for production.
