// This file is no longer strictly necessary as its logic has been integrated into src/app/cart/page.tsx
// for simplicity in this iteration. It can be removed or kept for future refactoring if cart item rendering
// becomes more complex.

// For now, I'll leave it empty to signify it's not currently used.
// If you wish to remove it from the project, you can do so.
// No specific content needed here for the current implementation.
