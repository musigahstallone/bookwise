## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn
*   A Firebase Project:
    *   Set up Firebase Storage.
    *   Obtain your Firebase project configuration credentials.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    # git clone <repository-url>
    # cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory by copying `.env` (if it exists as a template) or creating it manually. Add your Firebase project configuration:
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID" # Optional

    # If using Genkit with Google AI, also include:
    # GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

4.  **Configure Firebase Storage Rules (for development/prototyping):**
    In your Firebase Console, navigate to Storage > Rules. For easy development and testing of PDF uploads, you can use permissive rules. **IMPORTANT: These rules are NOT secure for production.**
    ```
    rules_version = '2';
    service firebase.storage {
      match /b/{bucket}/o {
        match /{allPaths=**} {
          // Allow read and write access to all paths for development
          // THIS IS NOT SECURE FOR PRODUCTION
          allow read, write: if true;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    For production, you would implement stricter rules, typically allowing writes only for authenticated admin users.

### Running the Development Server

1.  **Start the Next.js development server:**
    This will typically run the application on `http://localhost:9002` (as per `package.json`).
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **Start the Genkit development server (in a separate terminal, if using AI features):**
    This is required for the AI features to work. It usually runs on `http://localhost:3400`.
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    Or, for watching changes in AI flows:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the application.
The admin panel is accessible at [http://localhost:9002/admin](http://localhost:9002/admin).

## üìù Important Notes for Admin Panel

*   **Data Persistence**: Book metadata modifications (add, edit, delete names, descriptions, etc.) made in the admin panel are currently for the **current session only** and are stored in-memory. They will not persist across server restarts or application rebuilds. PDF files uploaded will persist in Firebase Storage. For full persistence of book metadata, integration with a database like Firebase Firestore is required.
*   **No Authentication**: The admin panel (`/admin`) is currently publicly accessible. In a production environment, this would need to be secured with authentication.

## üõ†Ô∏è Scripts
