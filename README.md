## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    # git clone <repository-url>
    # cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add any necessary environment variables (e.g., API keys for Genkit/Google AI).
    Refer to `.env.example` if provided, or the Genkit documentation for specifics.
    Example:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
    ```

### Running the Development Server

1.  **Start the Next.js development server:**
    This will typically run the application on `http://localhost:9002` (as per `package.json`).
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **Start the Genkit development server (in a separate terminal):**
    This is required for the AI features to work. It usually runs on `http://localhost:3400`.
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    Or, for watching changes in AI flows:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the application.
